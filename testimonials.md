Here's what people have to say about their experience with Formulate.

> Formulate is the most reliable forms plugin for Umbraco. It’s feature rich – but if you find anything lacking, it’s also open source and pluggable, so it’s extremely developer friendly and configurable. The creator (Nicholas Westby) is also quite helpful when you have an issue. With the new vanilla Javascript layout, it’s easier than ever to get what you want out of the plugin.
