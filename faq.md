# Frequently Asked Questions

* Does Formulate require AngularJS?
  * Not anymore. You can use the plain JavaScript template to avoid any frontend dependencies.
* Can I use Formulate on a site built with jQuery?
  * Yes. You will just have an extra dependency on AngularJS and Lodash, if you are using the AngularJS template. If you are using the plain JavaScript template, there are no external dependencies.
* Can I use Formulate on a site built with Foundation (or some other framework that is not Bootstrap)?
  * Yes. You can either create some custom styles or customize the built-in template to use Foundation classes.
* Will Formulate work with an Umbraco site built with Web Forms?
  * [Yes](https://github.com/Nicholas-Westby/web-formulate), though it was designed to work well with ASP.NET MVC.
* Do I need to be an AngularJS expert to use Formulate?
  * No. You can use Formulate with no AngularJS knowledge. However, AngularJS comes in handy when you want to customize Formulate forms built using the AngularJS template or when you want to customize Formulate in the Umbraco back office (which uses AngularJS).
* Can Formulate be used on a production site?
  * Yes. In fact, it already is used on many sites.
